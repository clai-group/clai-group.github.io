    "text": "Propensity Score Analysis for Medical Research : A Primer and Tutorial (PS Tutorial)\nPropensity score analysis is a popular method of adjusting for confounding in observational studies, i.e., studies where patients are not randomly assigned into treatment groups. Despite its popularity in medical research, there are many nuances to the method that are often missed by researchers, including about the assumptions required, the quantities that can be estimated, and the correct procedures for performing and reporting an analysis"
